Grand Media Gallery - powerfull media library plugin for creating beautiful galleries and managing files.

== Description ==

This plugin is in beta for now. I'm working hard to bring flash skins from my previous plugin ([Grand Flagallery](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/flash-album-gallery/)) to this one. Also I'll add many others modules based on jQuery library for desktop and mobile browsers.

As for now there is only one module called Afflux with touch/swipe interface on mobile browsers. Test it and give me know what problem you have or not have with Gmedia plugin.

Features:

*   SEO and mobile friendly, responsive galleries
*   Add tags and categories to uploaded files
*   Create many galleries with different options
*   Automatically add uploaded images to gallery related on tags

*   Manage Wordpress Media Library files much easier

TODO List:

*   More modules for creating galleries
*   Easily add to Post media files with tags related to post tags
